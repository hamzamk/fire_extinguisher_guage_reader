# fire_extinguisher_guage_reader

I have created custom Object detectors using Yolov4 and Faster-RCNN. They are trained on 700 labelled images of fire extinguisher guages. This model localizes, and classifies the guage between two classes that are 'expired' and 'usable'. Expired means the fire extinguisher has to be refilled or replaced else its usable.
