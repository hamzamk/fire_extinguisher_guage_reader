# fire_extinguisher_guage_reader

I have created custom Object detectors using Yolov4 and Faster-RCNN. They are trained on 700 labelled images of fire extinguisher guages. This model classifies detects the guage and classifies it between two classes expired and usable. Expired means the fire extinguisher has to be refilled or replaced else its usable.

check the results and test images in https://github.com/hamzamk/fire_extinguisher_guage_reader/tree/master/tensorflow-faster_rcnn/images
